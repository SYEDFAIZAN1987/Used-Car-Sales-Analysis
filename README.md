## 📘 About the Project

This project analyzes a dataset of **8,128 used car sales records** from **CarDekho.com**, India's largest online used car vendor. Spanning vehicles manufactured between 1994 and 2020, the dataset contains both numerical and categorical variables related to car specifications, sales trends, and market performance.

The project employs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, advanced **feature engineering**, and **regression modeling** to identify key factors affecting car prices and generate actionable insights for used car buyers and sellers.

## 🔍 Key Objectives

1. **Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering**:
   - Removed outliers and handled missing values.
   - Performed log transformations and categorical encoding.
   - Created new features like `age` and `maruti` for advanced analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Visualized relationships between variables using boxplots, bar charts, and correlation matrices.
   - Examined the impact of car make, age, mileage, and engine size on selling price.

3. **Regression Modeling**:
   - Built and evaluated **multiple regression models** to predict car prices.
   - Optimized the model using **All Subset Regression** to achieve an **Adjusted R²** of 0.795.

4. **Insights**:
   - **Intuitive Findings**:
     - Older cars sell at a lower price, with a robust negative correlation (-0.7).
     - Larger engine sizes lead to higher selling prices (0.52 correlation).
   - **Counterintuitive Insight**:
     - Cars with better mileage (fuel efficiency) are associated with slightly lower selling prices, possibly due to a preference for luxury vehicles.
